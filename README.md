# CUDA Game of life

-----
This repository implements straightforward Game of life algorithm.

Main purpose of this repository is to explore CUDA OpenGL interoperability. Usage of CUDA alongside with 
OpenGL provides opportunity to perform computation and render result within same device. This approach 
helps to minimize data transfers overheads.
